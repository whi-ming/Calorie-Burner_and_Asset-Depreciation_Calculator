# asignment 1
 
This short project is divided into two parts.

In the first part, a program is created to calulate the calories burned from a group of excerises: walking, running, mountain climbing. The answers are calculated with the aid of the user's weight in pounds and given constants to create the formula needed. Declaring variables, converting variables, and taking input are all explored in this first part.

In the second part, a program is created to calculate the yearly depreciation of an asset in dollars and life percentage. The program will also be able to calculate how many years it would take for the asset to reach 50% of its life. This second part expands on the first part by introducing formating printed strings.
